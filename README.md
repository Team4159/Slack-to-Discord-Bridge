# Important Note
**Do Not Delete Branch**<br>
This branch was created to save the commit history of the old repository (`Team4159/Slack2Discord`)<br>
The repository `Team4159/Slack-to-Discord-Bridge` was forked from a project that was created to replace it.<br>
Use your `git checkout` commands to dig through this project's history if you'd like. The `Legacy` folder contained the old code after January 2021 and it existed up until the `legacy-deleted` tag.<br>
The `legacy-deleted` tag is commit hash `ae715826acd15fecde5afe301eed16da6927ba59`<br>
See the archived code by using commands like `git checkout legacy-deleted~3` for 3 commits before `legacy-deleted` and `git checkout legacy-deleted~6` for 6 commits before `legacy-deleted`
