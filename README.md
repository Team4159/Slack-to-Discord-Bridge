# Slack2Discord
Copies messages from Slack to a Discord server<br>
Supports multiple channels and will create new channels on demand<br>
Files and Images are also supported up to 8MB (Discord File Size Limit)
##### Note: Messages will only be copied in real time. Any messages that are missed while the program is not running will not be sent retroactively.

### Running Slack-to-Discord-Bridge
First clone the repository with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Team4159/Slack2Discord`<br>
Alternatively, clone the repository normally and run `git submodule update --init --recursive`<br>
After running those commands, you will see a new `Slack-to-Discord-Bridge` folder<br>
Enter the folder and you will see a new `README.md` inside it<br>
Read the additional set-up instructions on that file to complete the set-up process.
